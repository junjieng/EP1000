           <p>  My project title is mood lamp this is to target uses that is in stress due to long period of work and by using the 
             mood lamp can reduce by looking at the colour could help user to reduce the amount of stress.  </p>
            <p> The venue that i get this idea for making this  projects is located at the past student project that is on my lecturer slides the reason that i choose this projects because  i finds that
              this project is easier and save time as i have five more core module to focus on so i plan to choose a more easier project  in order for me to 
              focus on my core module .

             <p> Pertaining to the drawing i apologised that my drawing was not that good</p>
             <p> The above is the draft of my project through manual drawing  and  the components that i am going to use which consists of a distance sensor, audrino nano ,  6 strip neopixel ,small breadboard  and connections cable. </p>

           <p> For baby yoda graphics this is the website that i have got from  <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/26740191526983966/"> Visit this website for Yoda Graphics!</a> </p>
           <p> After i got the graphic then i save the image as png and  after i have save the image as png i then covert the file to svg file after i have converted
             i will then import the graphic to the acrylic peice that i have designed in  fusion 360 through svg. </p> 
           <p> Length of the acrylic piece is 131mm and height is 6mm and thickness is 6mm </p>
