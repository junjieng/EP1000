            and two circles at the side next i will have to trim out the extra parts in order for the rectangle and two circle to
        be matched and i will use the diameter to to adjust the fram of the rectangle and circle 
        to the sizes  for both outer layer and inner layer that i wanted  </p>
        <img src="label .png" alt="label"style ="right:500px;height:500px;width:500px;">
        <p style="right: 400px"> The The tools that i have used for this model in fusion 360 are circle for the body and 
            and rectangle next i will have to trim out the extra parts in order for the rectangle and circle to
            be matched next i will have to offset the circle and rectangle  in order for the shape to appear. and lastly i will insert the text on the kechain</p>
        <img src="lego .png" alt="lego"style="right: 500px;height: 300px;width 300px;">
        <p style="right: 400px;">The tools i have used for this model in fusion 360 is rectangle and circle  first i will extrude out the rectangle to the  size that i want and next i will have to insert the 
        circle into the rectangle and extrude out the size for the circle after i have extrude out the circle i will have to use rectangular pattern 
    to extrude out the same sizes cricle after i extrude everything out i will have to use the shell function to cut 
out the bottom part and nexti will  insert the three circle below and for the circle i will have to use the rectangular pattern in order for the 
three circle to looks the same lastly i wil have to insert the text into the kechain .   </p>
