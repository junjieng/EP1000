    <h3 style="font-size: x-large;">About Autodesk fusion 360 </h3>
          <p> Autodesk fusion 360  is the software that is used to create a 3D object the tools thati have been using  in the 
              fusion 360 are  extrude,shell and retangular pattern and offset to perform the below sketch that i have done  
                 and in terms of shapes i have used a polygen, rectangular, circle and arc and line. </p>

        <p style="right: 400px;">The tools that i have used for this model in fusion 360 are rectangle and 
            and circles  for the outer layer next i will have  trim out the extra parts in order for the rectangle and next i will use the diameter to to adjust the fram of the rectangule and circle 
         to the sizes  for both outer layer and inner layerthat i wanted lastly i will insert the circle an the centralized rectanglar to the inner part of the drawings  </p>

        <p style="right: 400px;"> The The tools that i have used for this model in fusion 360 are rectangle and 
            and two circles at the side next i will have to trim out the extra parts in order for the rectangle and two circle to
        be matched and i will use the diameter to to adjust the fram of the rectangle and circle 
        to the sizes  for both outer layer and inner layerthat i wanted  </p>
        <img src="label .png" alt="label"style ="right:500px;height:500px;width:500px;">
        <p style="right: 400px"> The The tools that i have used for this model in fusion 360 are circle for the body and 
            and rectangle next i will have to trim out the extra parts in order for the rectangle and circle to
            be matched next i will have to offset the circle and rectangle  in order for the shape to appear. and lastly i will insert the text on the kechain</p>
        <img src="lego .png" alt="lego"style="right: 500px;height: 300px;width 300px;">
        <p style="right: 400px;">The tools i have used for this model in fusion 360 is rectangle and circle  first i will extrude out the rectangle to the  size that i want and next i will have to insert the 
        circle into the rectangle and extrude out the size for the circle after i have extrude out the circle i will have to use rectangular pattern 
    to extrude out the same sizes cricle after i extrude everything out i will have to use the shell function to cut 
out the bottom part and nexti will  insert the three circle below and for the circle i will have to use the rectangular pattern in order for the 
three circle to looks the same lastly i wil have to insert the text into the kechain .   </p>
        <img src="blocks.png" alt="blocks" style=" right: 500px; height:500px;width:500px;">
        <p style="right: 400px;">The tools i have used for this model in fusion 360 is line first i will have to draw out the cube one at a time by adjusting the sizes of the cube and next i wll have to extrude 
            one layer at a time after i have draw out the cube  after i have finished four layer i will have to adjust to the bottom of the model and use the shell to cut out the 
            diameter of the blocks lastly i wll have to insert the text into the keychain. <p>

        <p style="right: 400px;"> The tools that i have used for this model in fusion 360 are circle for the bodyand 
            and elipse for the handle first i will have to create the circle and use the diameter to measure the size that i want 
         after i have get the diameter i will use extrude to drag up the body part of the cup and after i have drag up i will create the 
        handle by using elipse to draw the handle  after i have finished drawings the handle i will extrude out the handle by selecting cut and 
       join and adjust the size of the handle. </p>
