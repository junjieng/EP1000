            <p> The venue that i get this idea for making this  projects is located at the past student project that is on my lecturer slides the reason that i choose this projects because  i finds that
              this project is easier and save time as i have five more core module to focus on so i plan to choose a more easier project  in order for me to 
              focus on my core module .
