             <p>Before i had my laser cut i will have to do the laser cutting certification quiz and in th quiz i tried 3 times  so 
                 for my first tries i scored 60%  and i decided to try the second times  and after i completed second tries i scored 70% and i decided to try for
                 thrid tries and in the thrid tries i manage to scored a 90% and next i have to import the parts into the  librecad to check whether the parts does it match

            <p> Firstly i will have to import my dxf file into  corel draw and align it by parts next i will insert the text  on my top pieces
                of my box by changing the size to comics sans and font sized of 20 and centralized the text after i have done i will click on print to 
                print it at the laser cutter software and  in the software i will have to check the following before sending my parts to the cutting machine and the settings consists of 
                changing of the settings to hairline and  i will have to ensure the air exist for both the engrave and vector is on, for the vector part
                i have to make sure the following settings which are the speed , power and frequency which are 15%, 75% and 50%

           <p> Secondly i wll sent the cut to the machine and i will have to change the settings at the laser cutter to jog and adjust the laser to the top right in order to make sure that 
               the laser cutter is at the zeroing position after i  have adjust i wil start lasercutting and when doing laser cutting i will have to close the lead first. In laser cutting the machine will start on  engraving and after the laser cutter have finished the engraving part  it will start
