                <img src="cura.png" alt="cura"style="width: 500;height:500px;">

                <p>  Before i had my  3d printing i will have to do the 3d printing  certification quiz and in th quiz i tried 3 times  so 
                for my first tries i scored 60%  and i decided to try the second times  and after i completed second tries i scored 70% and i decided to try for
                thrid tries and in the thrid tries i manage to scored a 90% and next i have to save the knight chess piece as STL file  and import the file to cura 
                after i have import the file into cura i have to change the wall thicknes into 0.8mm, infill i have to change it into 18 percent and infil pattern
                i have to change to grid and lastly for support i have to check the box to make sure there is support after i have finished with all the settings 
                i will have to slice it to make sure that the print does not be more than 45 mins.The above picture shows that i have slice
                the chess piece.</p>

                <img src="cura settings.JPG" alt=" cura setting" style="width: 500px;height: 500px;">
                <img src="cura settings (1).JPG" alt=" cura setting" style="width: 500px;height: 500px;">

               <p> Next after i have finished i will have to save the chess piece into the SD cards  in order for the machine
                  to print my chess piece before i start my printing  when the machine is being heated up at the same  time i will have to make sure that the 3d printer does not have any dust 
                  on the plate if there is no dust on the plate i will then be able to start my 3d printing first i will insert the SD card into the 
                  3d printer after i have insert i will start the 3d printing the above two pictures are settings for cura which was recommended by my lecturer.</p>

                  <img src="final product.JPG" alt=" final product" style="width: 500px;height: 500px;">

                 <p>After i have finshed the 3d printing i will have to let the machine cool down about 50 mins in order for me to collect my
                     prototype out after i get the prototype out i wil have to cut out the access parts in order for the prototype to look like a chess piece 
                     the above picture is the prototype that is succesfully printed and the next picture is the chess peiece that has been cut nicely without any access
                     parts.
