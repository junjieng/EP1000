              <p style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold;"> Week 4  </p>
              <p>In this week we were taught to learn more about using of github to publish our website in additionally the first thing
                we were told to create an account on github and download the github desktop by creating new reporsitory in order for us to insert our webpage 
                into the github, after we have insert our webpage into the github account we will have to copy our github website to the 
                excel spreadsheet for our lecturer to take a look on our progression on our website. In inserting of the github reporsitory i faces some problems 
                whereby the photo of my webpage does not shows up and i decided to figure out by doing reserach on the net on inserting of photo into the reporsitory
                through many tries i manage to insert the photo into github. 
              </p>
                     
              <p style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold;"> Week 5 </p>
            <p> In this week we were taught to learn more about the Fusion 360  with a sketch of spanner by watching 
              the youtube video that is given in the lecturer slides and we were taught by using of shapes to draw the items that we wanted to create such as line, 2 dimensional rectangle,
            circle, dimension and horizontal and vertical .In drawing of the shapes i had  difficulty in drawing as i does not have any knowledge of drawing so i decided to try it out 
          by using of the youtube video that was given in the lecturer slide to draw the sketch in fuion 360  and  what i did is to follow the 
        video steps and through many tries i manage to get the drawing for spanner.   </p>


        <p style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold;"> Week 6 </p>
        In this week we were introduce with a new function in fusion 360 which was  creating parameters ,extrude, text and shell  with a sketch of designing  a nametag and cubes. For creating the 
        parameter we will have to create the length, width , height  and thickness for the cube and nametag before we do a sketch on the items. so it will be easier for us 
        to sketch the dimension as the dimension is already fixed and after we have finished our sketch we will need to extrude out according to the parameter that has been already
        set and next if we want to cut a hole on the bottom part of the cube and nametag we wil need to shell it according to the size lastly if we wants to insert the name on the keychain we 
        will have to use the text fusion and insert into the keychain.
